## Additional Microverse Adjustments

### General

- Remember about descriptive README file.
- Inline comments: It’s better to delete commented code. If you need to review a previous version of your code, use git history.
- Files not related to the project should not be commited and added to .gitignore.
- Keep your code clean.
- Remember to use semantic HTML.
- Validate your HTML markup with https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload.
- Make sure you DON’T make common mistakes in your CSS styles.

### Project specific

- Remember to use Bootstrap CSS classes wherever it is possible - this is the main point of this project.
- As you can use a ready set of CSS classes, be more precise and make sure that you page looks exactly the same as the source page.
- Remember to double-check if you page layout does not break on smaller screens.
